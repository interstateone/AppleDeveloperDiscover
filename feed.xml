            <title>How to prepare your app for a global audience</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vdo2w6y4</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;How to prepare your app for a global audience&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The App Store is available in 175 countries and regions and 40 languages to make it easy for people around the world to discover and download your app. This week&#44; we&#8217;re showing you how localizing your app can help make it more relevant to local cultures and languages and help you grow your business &#8212;&#160;and that starts with preparing your app for a global audience. Structure your app for localization Internationalization&#44; the process of structuring your app&#8217;s code and UI for localization&#44; is a fundamental first step in building apps for a global audience. With Apple&#8217;s powerful tools and technologies&#44; including Xcode 11&#44; Apple APIs&#44; Auto Layout&#44; and Unicode support&#44; it&#8217;s easy to prepare your apps to support multiple languages and regions&#44; even before you know which languages you&#8217;d like to add.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In Xcode&#44; make sure your user-visible text and images are separate from your executable code. When you translate these elements into other languages&#44; you can integrate the content back into your app as separate localized resource files stored within the app bundle.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Images &#8212; including image sets&#44; Apple Watch complications&#44; Apple TV image stacks&#44; Sprite Atlases&#44; and symbol sets &#8212; can be localized directly in your Asset Catalog. You can also use localized &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/&#34;&#62;SF system symbols&#60;/a&#62; and set the directionality for custom symbols &#8212; for example&#44; for right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Use Apple APIs to correctly express user-visible or dynamically-generated values&#44; such as dates&#44; lengths&#44; weights&#44; prices&#44; and currency symbols&#44; across different locales. Ensure your app accepts user-generated text in any language and in multiple languages at once&#44; independent of the user interface language. This allows app content to appear in someone&#8217;s preferred language and format.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can also take advantage of Auto Layout to automatically adjust the dimensions and layouts of views&#44; extensive Unicode support to work with text from any language&#44; the powerful text handling technologies of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch to display&#44; lay out&#44; and edit text in many languages&#44; and much more.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/403/&#34;&#62;Watch &#8220;Create great localized experiences with Xcode 11&#8221; &#38;gt;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve2bc11fab&#34;&#62;Learn more about localizing your app in Xcode &#38;gt;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Investigate market factors Market-specific demographics&#44; such as population&#44; language&#44; and purchasing power&#44; can help you better understand areas that might have an affinity or need for your app. Every market has its own preferences for the types of apps or categories customers most enjoy. For example&#44; games are popular worldwide&#44; however strategy games may be more popular in a particular region.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consider selecting markets with similar attributes to those in which you have already established success&#44; such as strong app downloads&#44; sales&#44; usage&#44; or retention metrics&#44; as this may make for easier growth. When selecting a market&#44; assess how your app might fit in and how its value and functionality aligns with that market&#8217;s needs. You may even identify a need in the market that is not yet filled&#44; allowing you to bring unique value to people with your app. Use App Analytics to determine potential markets If you offer your app worldwide but haven&#8217;t localized for particular regions&#44; you can look at key performance metrics&#44; such as Product Page Views&#44; App Units&#44; Sales&#44; and Active Devices&#44; filtered by territory. This can help you determine if your app is attracting people in a particular territory that might benefit from localization. For example&#44; if your app is primarily in English and you see lower than average retention or Sessions per Active Device in Germany&#44; you might consider adding German language support. Keep in mind that some markets may have greater proficiency with your app&#8217;s primary language&#44; while others may require more significant localization work. Usage data such as active devices&#44; sessions&#44; and retention include only users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/analytics/?cid&#61;developer80&#34;&#62;Learn more about gaining insights with App Analytics &#38;gt;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consider local culture and customs While your app and product page should each provide a consistent experience across all markets&#44; it&#8217;s sometimes valuable to refine certain elements for cultural relevance. For example&#44; you might try incorporating market-specific content or cultural moments&#44; such as special holiday content or regional art styles. You may want to consider any local policies and market regulations&#44; as well as any political or religious sensitivities&#44; to increase the likelihood that your app is well received.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Resources &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/localization/?cid&#61;developer80&#34;&#62;Learn more about expanding your app to new markets &#38;gt;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/localization/resources/?cid&#61;developer80&#34;&#62;Get more resources for localization &#38;gt;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Meet the developer: Philip Lam</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wk9cj822</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Meet the developer: Philip Lam&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;HomeCourt is quite possibly the biggest thing to happen to basketball practice since the invention of the sneaker.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The app uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) and augmented reality (AR) to create and shape on-court basketball drills. It can tell whether you&#8217;re shooting off the dribble&#44; catching and shooting&#44; or just practicing free throws. It will measure your release time and the angle of your shot. It knows how fast you&#8217;re moving before you shoot. It calculates your vertical leap. And after your workout&#44; you can see performance charts and a video breakdown right away. It&#8217;s a metrics fan&#8217;s dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;HomeCourt offers real-time coaching as well. With the help of your iPhone or iPad&#8217;s front-facing camera&#44; you can get real-time feedback from coaches across town or on the other side of the globe.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As people shelter in place around the world&#44; HomeCourt has made its services free to everyone through May 31. A recent feature update also lets coaches create a virtual team roster in the app&#44; so players&#44; coaches&#44; and parents can participate in remote workouts&#44; drills&#44; and competitions. The company is also working on other ways it can support basketball players and coaches while school activities&#44; practices&#44; and tournaments are being cancelled or postponed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Cofounder Philip Lam says the company&#8217;s shot-tracking prototype kicked everything off. &#8220;Even though it could only track shots in a few specific situations&#44;&#8221; he says&#44; &#8220;it made us believe it was possible to use a single smartphone camera to track complex basketball activities.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Today the company has 22 employees in Hong Kong and San Jose&#44; California&#44; and players across the globe.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here Lam explains how HomeCourt got into the game:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#8221;Before we launched&#44; we played pickup basketball every week&#44; and we started talking about how great it would be if we could get our stats &#8212; who hit the most shots&#44; who got the most rebounds&#44; all that stuff. And the idea just came up: Can we actually use the camera on the phone to do that for us? That&#8217;s how it started.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;We built HomeCourt on mobile to make it affordable to players around the world. We came up with the idea of simulating the Stephen Curry tennis-ball drill with an interactive AR experience. That turned out to be the foundation of HomeCourt&#8217;s dribble workout. Everyone on the team was really excited to try it and compete with each other.&#8221;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#8221;Most other basketball training applications are content-based &#8212; no other mobile solution provides this system of proven training techniques combined with real-time A.I.-powered analysis.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;In mid-2018&#44; we built a prototype that could track advanced metrics&#44; like release angle&#44; release time&#44; and vertical jump. We named this feature Shot Science. At that time&#44; the iPhone X was the latest iOS device. It was powerful&#44; but it still wasn&#8217;t fast enough to run Shot Science in real time and enable players to hear audio shot analysis during a live practice.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;The new iPhone series came in September 2018&#44; and it was a much more powerful device for running machine-learning algorithms. We found our algorithm &#91;ran&#93; six times faster in the iPhone series with the A12 Bionic chip. With the optimization in our algorithm&#44; we could finally offer Real-Time Shot Science. The opportunity to demonstrate that at the 2018 Apple iPhone event &#91;was&#93; definitely one of the most special days in our journey so far.&#8221;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#8221;We&#8217;ve had parents tell us that it becomes a competition with videogames: &#8220;Oh&#44; they really do practice more&#44; and they play fewer videogames&#44; and I&#8217;m really happy about it&#33;&#8221; And I&#8217;m really happy about it too&#33;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;And&#44; yes&#44; we still definitely play every week.&#8221;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Originally published on the App Store.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Design launch screens for seamless starts</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=voseytot</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Design launch screens for seamless starts&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Instantaneous app launches are a big part of providing a great experience on iPhone or iPad. Whether someone is tapping on your app icon for the first time or returning from elsewhere&#44; they should be able to get started immediately. A launch screen lets you provide that seamless and adaptive experience while your app loads any pertinent information in the background&#44; and you can create it directly in Xcode.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Designing the right storyboard for your launch screen can make a world of difference in how quickly you can immerse people into your user interface. Here are a few recommendations and tips to help you create great launch screens for your app. Support all device screen sizes by creating launch screen storyboards in Xcode Although people won&#8217;t be able to interact with your launch screen&#44; you should always build your screen using an Xcode storyboard. Storyboards are flexible and adaptable and support all device screen sizes&#44; which allows you to use a single storyboard to manage your launch screens for every platform you support.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Note: Don&#39;t use a static image for your launch screen. Static images have been deprecated and all App Store apps must use an Xcode storyboard to provide an app&#8217;s launch screen by June 30&#44; 2020. Learn more &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/news/?id&#61;03262020b&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/em&#62; Mirror your main screen The fastest way to convince someone your app is responsive and ready to go is to show them the same interface in your launch screen that they expect on your app&#8217;s main screen.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When an app first starts up&#44; it shows its launch screen before transitioning to the main interface. When someone switches away&#44; the app automatically saves an App Snapshot of its interface so that it can return to where they left off; if an app can&#8217;t restore its state in this way&#44; however&#44; it will display the launch screen instead.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As such&#44; you want to make sure your launch screen storyboard looks close to identical to your main interface. If you include elements that look dramatically different&#44; it may be confusing or jarring when your app shifts to the main screen. If you have an app that might take a bit longer to load&#44; like a game&#44; and you&#8217;d like to provide any kind of animated experience during that time&#44; we recommend using a solid color background; from there&#44; the app can move gracefully to the game&#8217;s first screen.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Consider the light and the dark When someone launches your app&#44; you want them to feel immersed &#8212; no matter their appearance settings. We&#8217;ve already addressed how to create adaptive launch screen storyboards&#44; but it&#8217;s also important to think about a device&#8217;s appearance. If your app supports Dark Mode&#44; your launch screen storyboard should as well. Make sure that your storyboard uses adaptive colors&#44; and set the background of the view to the System Background Color. Assess your assets Anything you add to your launch screen storyboard should be optimized appropriately. If you want to add an asset to your storyboard&#44; such as a static image that normally appears as part of your app&#8217;s user interface&#44; make sure that its image dimensions are no larger than the view it&#39;s going to be placed in. Your storyboard may not display if you use assets at larger resolutions. Launch with a global audience in mind Unlike your app&#8217;s interface&#44; your app&#8217;s launch screen can&#8217;t be localized into other languages: Any text you display in your storyboard will remain in the original language you select. As such&#44; it&#39;s best to avoid including any text at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Resources &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/423/&#34;&#62;Watch &#8220;Optimizing app launch&#8221;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DesigningwithStoryboards.html&#34;&#62;Learn more about designing with storyboards in the Developer Library&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/launch-screen/&#34;&#62;Learn more about launch screens in the Human Interface Guidelines&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/#/dev31645f17f&#34;&#62;Learn how to create a Storyboard using Interface Builder&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/responding_to_the_launch_of_your_app&#34;&#62;Learn more about responding to app launches in the Developer Library&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/#/dev62c993289&#34;&#62;Learn more about storyboards&#44; scenes&#44; and connections in the Xcode guide&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface&#34;&#62;Learn more about supporting Dark Mode in your interface in the Developer Library&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>How to implement UI state restoration</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4ixc0yxs</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;How to implement UI state restoration&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;People naturally multitask on their devices. Whether they&#8217;re switching from app to app&#44; bringing together apps on iPad using Slide Over or Split View&#44; or creating multiple windows of the same app&#44; they should be able to pick up right where they left off &#8212;&#160;and UI state restoration is a core part of making that experience seamless.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When your app goes out of view&#44; the app&#8217;s process is typically put on pause; it&#8217;s not given any more CPU time&#44; which keeps the processor free for other tasks. If your app has background processes that are running&#44; the system can even terminate those if an active app needs more resources than currently available.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Restoring the state of your UI is a crucial part of making your app feel responsive &#8212;&#160;and it&#8217;s especially important if you plan to support multiple windows in your iPadOS app. If you have a note-taking app that has four different notes open in different Split View pairings&#44; for example&#44; state restoration helps preserve each note&#44; rather than returning someone to the main screen when they open one of the windows.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meet NSUserActivity&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62; is a core part of modern state restoration with &#60;code&#62;UIScene&#60;/code&#62; and &#60;code&#62;UISceneDelegate&#60;/code&#62;: It provides a lightweight way to capture the state of your app and put it to use later&#44; holding key information for both view controllers and important view states &#8212; information that can also be used when constructing view controllers for &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/task_management/implementing_handoff_in_your_app&#34;&#62;Handoff&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content&#34;&#62;Universal Linking&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While what you store in &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62; is up to you&#44; we recommend collecting only the bare minimum so that your app can quickly restore itself. Think of the most unique and simple way you can identify your view controller&#44; like a clear identifier or URL. Include that information&#44; and make sure you can identify where the view controller lives in your navigation and how content should appear within it. For example&#44; when using an Xcode storyboard you may want to store and retrieve view controllers using restoration IDs. Get started with UI state restoration The best way to implement UI state restoration is to make your app scene-based&#44; which requires iOS 13&#44; iPadOS 13&#44; Mac Catalyst 10.13&#44; or tvOS 13 or later. (For more information on working with scenes in your app&#44; check out the &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes&#34;&#62;Developer Library&#60;/a&#62;.) Here&#8217;s how to get started with scene-based state restoration:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol&#62;&#60;li&#62;Create a &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62; object to save the app&#39;s state. This can be created in your scene delegate.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;In this &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62;&#44; store relevant information (like the current navigation&#8217;s state&#44; and view controllers that have been presented or pushed) along with your user&#8217;s intent.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Return this &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62; within &#60;code&#62;stateRestorationActivity(for:)&#60;/code&#62; in the scene delegate.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;&#60;p&#62;This &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62; will now be stored inside the scene&#8217;s&#160;&#60;code&#62;stateRestorationActivity&#60;/code&#62; property. When your app needs to restore its state&#44; it should do so by looking for this saved &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62; under &#60;code&#62;scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)&#60;/code&#62; in the scene delegate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;What about the older view controller-based state restoration APIs?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you need to support older versions of iOS&#44; macOS&#44; or tvOS&#44; you can use older view controller-based APIs for state restoration via restoration classes and the app delegate. This also means if you want to update your app to adopt UIScene as well as implement UI state restoration across multiple versions of iOS&#44; you will need to implement both scene-based and view-controller based APIs. However&#44; we highly recommend building scene-based UI state restoration.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Compared to the older APIs&#44; modern state restoration requires a different approach to how you define&#44; save&#44; and restore your UI state and your user&#8217;s intent. With a scene-based app&#44; you have to separate events in an application&#8217;s life cycle and the scene&#8217;s life cycle&#44; which means tracking changes also differs. Having multiple scenes means there are many more windows to track&#44; each with unique user actions and navigation history. For some of those windows&#44; you may choose not to restore state depending on their function&#44; requiring state restoration to be more flexible and dependent on how you define the user&#8217;s intent.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you can update your app to scene-based restoration and take advantage of &#60;code&#62;NSUserActivity&#60;/code&#62;&#44; you&#8217;ll also unlock easier pathways to implementing features like Spotlight search&#44; Handoff&#44; enabling Universal Links&#44; and creating new scenes as primary or auxiliary windows. And you&#8217;ll provide a smoother and frictionless experience for people using your app&#44; too.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Resources &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/258/&#34;&#62;Watch &#8220;Architecting your app for multiple windows&#8221;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/259/&#34;&#62;Watch &#8220;Targeting content with multiple windows&#8221;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/246/&#34;&#62;Watch &#8220;Window management in your multitasking app&#8221;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/preserving_your_app_s_ui_across_launches&#34;&#62;Learn more about restoring state in non-scene based apps&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/restoring_your_app_s_state&#34;&#62;Explore sample code for restoring your app&#8217;s state&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Meet the developer: Brian Mueller</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8xd0lp1u</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Meet the developer: Brian Mueller&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Brian Mueller is something of a Renaissance man. He single-handedly codes&#44; designs&#44; illustrates&#44; and writes all of the dialogue for his wisecracking Carrot apps&#44; which fall into categories that typically don&#8217;t have a lot of personality: to-do lists&#44; alarm clocks&#44; calorie counters.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To call his style droll would be an understatement. The exercise app &#60;em&#62;Carrot Fit&#60;/em&#62;&#44; for instance&#44; implores you to &#8220;jump flabby human&#44; jump for freedom&#33;&#8221; in a deadpan robotic voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;For more about Brian Mueller and his approach&#44; check out &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/grailr/?cid&#61;developer80&#34;&#62;this video interview&#60;/a&#62; where he details Carrot Weather&#8217;s evolution on Apple Watch.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Carrot To-Do&#60;/em&#62; is equally sardonic &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s been 18 hours since you did anything useful&#8221; &#8212; while &#60;em&#62;Carrot Weather&#60;/em&#62; takes liberties with its forecasts. &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful day&#33; Ha ha&#44; just kidding. It&#8217;s raining.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A smack-talking to-do list app might not seem like the big idea that would let you quit your day job. In fact&#44; Carrot&#8217;s success caught even Mueller off guard. &#8220;For some reason&#44; people have responded to this. I still can&#8217;t believe sometimes any of this caught on&#44;&#8221; he says.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Working out of a spare room in his Philadelphia-area home&#44; the former aspiring screenwriter has penned thousands of lines of dialogue for his apps&#44; which he constantly updates to nod to current events. (A recent one-liner from &#60;em&#62;Carrot Weather&#60;/em&#62;: &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell anyone&#44; but I regularly send bad weather to areas with high concentrations of stay-at-home order protesters.&#8221;)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As for the inspiration for &#60;em&#62;Carrot&#60;/em&#62;&#44; Mueller credits those closest to him: his mom&#44; sister&#44; and wife &#8212; all of whom tease one another relentlessly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;A lot of the dialogue for &#60;em&#62;Carrot&#60;/em&#62; is drawn out of stuff that we&#8217;ve actually said to each other&#44;&#8221; he says. &#8220;Every time my wife says something funny&#44; I write it down for the apps. Sometimes she gets annoyed by that&#44; but she&#8217;s a lot funnier than I am.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When Mueller dreamed up the idea to create a character-driven app&#44; he had zero coding experience. &#8220;I&#8217;m an English major with a creative-writing minor. I love to write and create characters and tell stories&#44; but I had no real idea of what I would do with my life.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mueller&#8217;s first instinct was to hire a developer to realize his vision. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to sound like a jerk when talking to a programmer&#44; so I bought a book on iOS programming for beginners&#44; just to know what terms to use&#44;&#8221; he says. As he read &#60;em&#62;iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide&#60;/em&#62;&#44; Mueller was surprised by how easy it is to make an app. By January 2013&#44; &#60;em&#62;Carrot To-Do&#60;/em&#62; had launched on the App Store. It took him about a month to create.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;I love to write and create characters and tell stories&#44; but I had no real idea of what I would do with my life.&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;mdash; Brian Mueller&#44; Carrot creator&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Initially&#44; sales were tepid. It took a couple of years&#44; and a few more apps&#44; before &#60;em&#62;Carrot&#60;/em&#62; found a broad-enough audience for Mueller to quit his day job and become a full-time developer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The &#60;em&#62;Carrot&#60;/em&#62; universe continues to expand. Mueller has built seven iOS apps and an iOS sticker pack&#44; as well as Apple Watch&#44; Apple TV&#44; and Mac versions of &#60;em&#62;Carrot Weather&#60;/em&#62;. With the arrival of AR (augmented reality) technologies on iOS&#44; Mueller taught himself how to add an AR component to &#60;em&#62;Carrot Weather&#60;/em&#62;. Now you can see the surly character Carrot as a spherical &#8220;ocular sensor&#8221; hovering in your surroundings. She turns red if you annoy her.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although being a one-man app shop isn&#8217;t easy&#44; Mueller enjoys wearing all the hats. &#8220;When I hit a road block with coding&#44; I can take a break and switch to writing or doing some design work&#44;&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m not stuck doing the same thing over and over.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#39;s a weird way to work&#44; but I&#39;m a bit of a perfectionist and it allows me to make exactly what I want.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Originally published on the App Store.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Upcoming price and tax changes in Barbados&#44; Malaysia&#44; Moldova&#44; and Uzbekistan</title>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Upcoming price and tax changes in Barbados&#44; Malaysia&#44; Moldova&#44; and Uzbekistan&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When taxes or foreign exchange rates change&#44; we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store. In the next few days&#44; prices of apps on the App Store and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) will change in Barbados&#44; Moldova&#44; and Uzbekistan due to new value-added taxes. Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly and will be calculated based on the tax-exclusive price. A low value-added tax was also introduced in Malaysia. Prices on the App Store in Malaysia will not change and proceeds will be adjusted accordingly. You can download the updated price tier charts now. Once these changes go into effect&#44; the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in App Store Connect. If you offer subscriptions&#44; you can choose to preserve prices for existing subscribers. &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/0420-Apps-Pricing.pdf&#34;&#62;View updated price tiers&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Design a great in-app purchase experience for Apple Watch</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wl3gnk1h</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Design a great in-app purchase experience for Apple Watch&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Your Apple Watch apps can help people achieve their personal fitness goals&#44; monitor their health&#44; get actionable information straight to their wrist&#44; and so much more. And with watchOS 6.2&#44; you can further expand your customers&#8217; experiences by offering in-app purchases and subscription flows directly on Apple Watch.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These interactions use the same StoreKit APIs available for iOS app development&#44; allowing you to quickly implement them in your watchOS apps&#44; and they can be added to both independent watchOS apps (which can function fully independently of an iOS app) and dependent watchOS apps (which need an iOS companion app to function).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Let&#8217;s take a look at why and when you might want to offer purchases within your app&#44; as well as some best practices around implementing a great flow for your customers. When to offer in-app purchases and subscriptions In-app purchases and subscriptions can make your Apple Watch apps even better by offering both additional content and purchasing flexibility.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you have an independent app&#44; people can already download it directly through the Watch App Store&#44; and in-app purchases and subscriptions build upon that independence. Apps dependent on the companion iOS app can benefit&#44; too&#44; as these give people more power to purchase additional content without having to reach for their iPhone.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When deciding whether to bring an in-app purchase or subscription flow to your app&#44; consider what you&#8217;re offering. Does this purchase or subscription unlock anything specific to Apple Watch? Fitness apps&#44; for instance&#44; might supply additional workouts&#44; or let your customers subscribe to a monthly program.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Once you&#8217;ve decided to add an in-app purchase or subscription&#44; give some thought to when your app should display it. These prompts are most helpful when they provide a next step for your customers to unlock further functionality within your app. Best practices for a great in-app purchase and subscription experience Effective purchase flows on Apple Watch are concise and clear. Your messaging must be easily scannable&#44; and your options must be easy to compare with each other on a small screen. Keeping things short and sweet will help ensure that people can evaluate the choices&#44; make a decision quickly&#44; and carry on with the task at hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Make your choices clear&#60;/strong&#62; When offering one-time purchases and subscriptions alongside each other&#44; ensure that every option is defined clearly. Adding written overviews can help people differentiate between the two and make an informed choice.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We recommend including the following information in your overview: - What this purchase enables on your Apple Watch app - Whether it&#8217;s a one-time purchase or recurring subscription&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Restore the past&#60;/strong&#62; Whenever you offer subscription or in-app purchase content&#44; provide a way for people to restore their subscriptions or purchases. The same goes for Apple Watch: Make sure your app presents a button below the option to purchase that can check for previously purchased content and restore it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Don&#8217;t forget the fine print&#60;/strong&#62; While reading your subscription&#8217;s terms and conditions on Apple Watch may not sound like the most fun way for someone to spend their time&#44; it&#8217;s important that your customers know exactly what they&#8217;re getting when they purchase something within your app. Every time you include a purchase screen on Apple Watch&#44; you must include an option to read terms and conditions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Review the App Store guidelines&#60;/strong&#62; There are specific requirements you need to include in your Watch app before you make in-app purchases and subscriptions available to your customers; check the &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/resources/&#34;&#62;App Store&#8217;s Guidelines and Resources&#60;/a&#62; for more information.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Resources &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps&#34;&#62;Watch &#8220;Creating Independent watchOS apps&#8221;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#subscription-offers&#34;&#62;Learn more about auto-renewable subscriptions&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/&#34;&#62;Learn more about in-app purchases&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Meet the developer: Catana Chetwynd</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ab1gdyed</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Meet the developer: Catana Chetwynd&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thanksgiving with her boyfriend&#8217;s parents&#44; a bout of the flu&#44; and a &#8220;very old&#8221; iPad. These were the circumstances that gave rise to Catana Chetwynd&#8217;s beloved cartoons back in 2016&#44; when she was 21 years old.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I had been playing around with drawing on the iPad for a few months and John &#91;now her fianc&#233;&#93; suggested that I make a comic&#44;&#8221; she says. &#8220;It seemed like a good way to pass the time&#44; since I wasn&#8217;t feeling well. Turns out&#44; it was really fun&#33;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Over the next few days&#44; she drew five more comics based on everyday situations in her relationship&#44; like not-so-subtly requesting back rubs from John and rolling her eyes at his juvenile jokes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;John&#44; a software engineer&#44; posted them on Reddit&#44; and the internet fell hard: more than 2&#44;000 comments poured in. &#8220;We were really surprised by the flood of positive responses&#44;&#8221; Chetwynd says. John set up a website and she created an Instagram account&#8212;which now has nearly 3 million followers&#8212;and Catana Comics was born. &#8220;There are some incredibly awesome webcomics out there&#44;&#8221; Chetwynd says&#44; &#8220;but when we started&#44; there weren&#8217;t really any based on a couple.&#8221; She has found that most of her fans enjoy sharing her comics with a significant other.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It makes sense&#44; then&#44; that the number-one request Chetwynd got from her followers was for a sticker pack. With the Catana Comics iMessage app&#44; fans can easily exchange her big-eyed&#44; huge-hearted caricatures with a special someone. &#8220;Shortly after we came out with the first batch of stickers&#44;&#8221; Chetwynd says&#44; &#8220;I received an email from a woman who said that her husband was on a very long business trip in a different time zone. She loved that the stickers allowed them to quickly send emotive messages without using words.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Chetwynd can relate&#44; since she and John connect via her stickers too: &#8220;We both work from home&#44; but in different rooms&#44; and there are so many days where the only communication we&#8217;ll have is sending each other a sticker every hour or so.&#8221; One of her go-tos: a drawing of John looking at a picture of her saying&#44; &#8220;I miss you.&#8221; &#8220;It was in the very first release and I wasn&#8217;t thinking it could be funny when I made it&#44; but now John will go to the bathroom and I&#8217;ll send it to him&#44;&#8221; she says. &#8220;I use it almost every day.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Originally published on the App Store.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>How to support Route Guidance in CarPlay Dashboard</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=tsmnvknj</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;How to support Route Guidance in CarPlay Dashboard&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CarPlay&#160;Dashboard consolidates music&#44; maps&#44; and Siri suggestions into a single screen inside your car for a safer&#44; smarter experience. Starting with iOS 13.4&#44; you can add support for CarPlay Dashboard in your navigation app&#44; too: Make your map&#44; upcoming maneuvers&#44; and dashboard buttons available at a glance by adopting a few new capabilities inside the CarPlay framework.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Note: To integrate your app with CarPlay Dashboard&#44; your CarPlay navigation app needs to support &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes&#34;&#62;UIScene&#60;/a&#62;. For more information on adopting UIScene&#44; check out &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/212/&#34;&#62;&#8220;Introducing Multiple Windows on iPad&#8221;&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/em&#62; Get started with CarPlay Dashboard To support CarPlay Dashboard inside your navigation app&#44; you&#8217;ll need to update to &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/download/&#34;&#62;Xcode 11.4&#60;/a&#62; if you haven&#8217;t already.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;iOS 13.4 offers new capabilities within the CarPlay framework: &#60;code&#62;CPDashboardButton&#60;/code&#62;&#44; &#60;code&#62;CPDashboardController&#60;/code&#62;&#44; and &#60;code&#62;CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene&#60;/code&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene is a new UIScene subclass that CarPlay creates when it determines that your app should appear in CarPlay Dashboard.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CPDashboardController and CPDashboardButton let you manage controls that appear in CarPlay Dashboard. How to add support for CarPlay Dashboard To take advantage of CarPlay Dashboard&#44; start by supporting CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene and its related protocol CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Note: You need use CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate instead of CPApplicationDelegate to support this feature.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We&#8217;ll take you through each step below. In addition&#44; we&#8217;ve provided a sample application scene manifest for your reference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Step 1: Create a scene delegate&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To begin&#44; define a scene delegate for CPTemplateApplicationSceneSessionRoleApplication. This can be done dynamically in your UIApplicationDelegate by returning a configuration in application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession:options:&#44; or ahead of time in your app&#39;s Info.plist in the Application Scene Manifest.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The delegate must conform to CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate&#44; where it will be given an instance of CPInterfaceController and CPWindow&#44; as you&#39;ve been used to with CPApplicationDelegate.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Additionally&#44; to support CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene&#44; include a new key in your Application Scene Manifest to declare support for CarPlay Dashboard: CPSupportsDashboardNavigationScene with a value of true.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Step 2: Define the dashboard delegate&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Next define your delegate to the dashboard scene just like you would for the main template application scene. This delegate conforms to CPTemplateApplicationDashboardSceneDelegate and will be given an instance of CPDashboardController and UIWindow.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Step 3: Draw your CarPlay Dashboard content&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Use the provided window to draw navigation related content for display in the CarPlay Dashboard&#44; similar to the CPWindow given to the main template application scene. You can also provide two instances of CPDashboardButton to CPDashboardController that appear in the guidance card widget while your app is not actively navigating.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Step 4: Use your app in CarPlay Dashboard&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;People can interact with your app through both the dashboard buttons as well as within your main app interface. When navigation begins in your app using CPMapTemplate and CPNavigationSession&#44; CarPlay will automatically display maneuvers in the guidance widget. When navigation ends&#44; it will revert to your currently set dashboard buttons.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Resources &#60;a href&#61;&#34;http://developer.apple.com/carplay&#34;&#62;Learn more about creating apps for CarPlay&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/integrating_carplay_with_your_navigation_app&#34;&#62;Learn more about integrating CarPlay with your navigation app in the Developer Library&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Should I use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController for web views in my app?</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=trjs0tcd</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Should I use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController for web views in my app?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Whether your app needs to provide a full web browsing experience&#44; display richly-styled content&#44; or incorporate external websites without taking people out of your app&#44; you can make the experience smooth and seamless by choosing the right API.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can display web content inside of your app with both the WKWebView and SFSafariViewController APIs. But which is the best for your app&#8217;s needs?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Note: If your app uses the deprecated UIWebView API to display web content&#44; you will need to update your code as soon as possible for improved security&#44; performance&#44; and reliability. Learn more &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/news/?id&#61;12232019b&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;WKWebView&#60;/strong&#62; is part of the WebKit framework: It allows you to embed web content into your app as a seamless part of your app&#8217;s UI. You can present a full or partial view of web content directly in your app by loading a view that leverages existing HTML&#44; CSS&#44; and JavaScript content or create your own if your layout and styling requirements are better satisfied by using web technologies. &#60;strong&#62;SFSafariViewController&#60;/strong&#62; is part of the SafariServices framework&#44; and lets your users browse a web page&#44; or a website right inside your app. With it&#44; people can enjoy the same web browsing experience they get in Safari &#8212; including features like Password Autofill&#44; Reader&#44; and Secure Browsing &#8212;&#160;without ever having to leave your app.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These two APIs can provide a lot of the heavy lifting for web technologies in your app&#44; though there are a few instances where we recommend alternative frameworks. For example&#44; when presenting a web-based login screen for your app&#44; use ASWebAuthenticationSession to provide people with the most secure experience. When should I use WKWebView? If you need to customize or control the display of web content &#8212;&#160;or interact with the content itself &#8212; WKWebView will be most flexible in helping you build the implementation that suits your needs. (If your app is designed to be used offline&#44; make sure any WKWebView content has appropriate fallbacks and alerts.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Additionally&#44; consider WKWebView if you need to display HTML or CSS content inline or as part of rest of your app&#8217;s user interface.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In short&#44; WKWebView is an incredibly powerful technology that works in tandem with iOS and macOS frameworks. That said&#44; WKWebView is not designed to outright replace system technologies and frameworks. For example&#44; you should avoid using it in place of device-optimized UIKit classes like UITableView&#44; UIImage&#44; and UIButton&#44; as you lose out on core system behaviors and provide a subpar experience for people who use your app. When should I use SFSafariViewController? When you want display websites inside your app without sending people to Safari&#44; the best tool is SFSafariViewController. By using this API&#44; you can effectively embed the Safari interface &#8212;&#160;and many of its key features and privacy protections &#8212;&#160;into your app.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;SFSafariViewController is best used when you need to display interactive web experiences on websites you don&#8217;t own&#44; or showcase parts of your web content that are generally outside the scope of your app.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;Resources &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview&#34;&#62;Learn more about WKWebView&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller&#34;&#62;Learn more about SFSafariViewController&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/220&#34;&#62;Watch Customized Loading in WKWebView&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/225&#34;&#62;Watch What&#39;s New in Safari View Controller&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Meet the Developer: Rich Siegel</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=r2xowjrr</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Meet the Developer: Rich Siegel&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;BBEdit may be one of the most beloved developer tools on any platform&#44; but its creator&#44; Rich Siegel&#44; had relatively modest ambitions. He started writing the first version of the software back in 1989 because he needed an editor that could handle &#8220;large&#8221; files&#8212;something north of 32 KB.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;One of the limitations of Macintosh Pascal was that source files couldn&#8217;t be more than 32 kilobytes&#44;&#8221; he explains.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Over a quarter century has passed since BBEdit&#8217;s commercial debut&#44; and the app has become a favorite among developers&#44; scientists&#44; web designers&#44; and writers alike for its sheer power and speed. (Siegel regularly tests 12 GB files these days.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Siegel remains BBEdit&#8217;s principal architect and lead engineer&#44; and the caffeine molecule tattooed on his arm says a lot about his work ethic. We spoke with him from his Bare Bones Software headquarters north of Boston&#44; which Siegel shares with a pair of African gray parrots.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/&#34;&#62;Developers&#44; do you have an interesting story to tell? The App Store&#8216;s editorial team would love to hear it&#33;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;hr/&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;What were the early days of BBEdit like?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Back then&#44; the way to put Mac software out in the world was to submit it to the Info-Mac Archive&#44; an FTP repository hosted by Stanford. So that&#8217;s what I did&#44; and word started to spread pretty fast online.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I had mentioned that if anyone wanted a copy on disk&#44; they could mail a floppy and a self-addressed return envelope to me at my home. I was inundated with floppies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;BBEdit has been around for a lifetime by software standards. How have you seen the user base change?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our base started as Mac software developers&#44; scientists&#44; system administrators&#44; and other technical users. The first big change was popularity among HTML authors and web back-end developers. As word spread&#44; we were able to help folks understand that the internet was built with text&#8212;that you could treat text as data or you could treat it as a document. So the next wave brought in internet architects&#44; cryptanalysts&#44; and scientists from unexpected disciplines.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The third wave has been mostly writers and other content creators&#8212;folks who see their text not as data but as words&#44; and who want as little as possible between them and their words.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;However&#44; as many changes as we&#8217;ve seen&#44; there has been a delightful constancy to our customers: They&#8217;re people who simply want to get work done. They&#8217;re not distracted by shiny things in their software tools.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;What are some of the more surprising projects you&#8217;ve seen people create with BBEdit?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There&#8217;s been so much&#33; Our customers have used BBEdit to create novels&#44; doctoral theses&#44; and other long written works. One customer has used BBEdit as part of the development workflow to fly UAVs &#91;unmanned aerial vehicles&#93; the size of an F-16; the flight control system sends data to BBEdit in real time&#44; where the engineers examine it&#44; change it&#44; and send it back to the aircraft in just a few seconds. And the Human Genome Project even uses BBEdit to help analyze long sequences of DNA.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;How has the software evolved over the years?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;BBEdit has undergone one huge technical transformation after another. First there was the port to PowerPC. We developed an OpenDoc component&#44; and some of the internal architecture work we did for that is still in use.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Then came a nearly complete rewrite of its internal architecture&#44; followed closely by a port to Mac OS X&#8212;BBEdit was the first third-party application to run natively on that new OS&#8212;and then the port to Intel. Last year we finished rewriting BBEdit again&#44; this time as an AppKit application.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In between PowerPC and OpenDoc&#44; there was another development: the emergence of the World Wide Web. BBEdit had a plug-in model at the time&#44; and two of our customers&#8212;one in the UK and one in Spain&#8212;independently wrote HTML markup tools. This was 1995&#44; and we had no idea what HTML was&#44; but we could tell that it was going somewhere. So we evaluated the tools&#44; chose a set of them to bundle with BBEdit&#44; and off we went. Little did we know...&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;BBEdit is one of the most beloved apps out there. Why do you think that is?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We&#8217;ve always had the utmost respect for the user. Every internal decision about look and function answers the questions &#8220;What does the customer need?&#8221; and &#8220;How can we help them be more productive?&#8221; (Not &#8220;How can we give them what they&#8217;re asking for?&#8221; because that isn&#8217;t the right question to answer.) The Macintosh was introduced to help anybody do great things. It&#8217;s something we believe in completely. &#60;em&#62;Originally published on the Mac App Store.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>How to review your app&#8217;s crash logs</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nra79npr</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;How to review your app&#8217;s crash logs&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While we&#8217;d all prefer it if our apps never crashed&#44; the logs captured from those crashes can help you troubleshoot pesky bugs and get your app up and running again. If and when something goes awry&#44; your app automatically gathers crash reports from people who have opted in to send you anonymized crash data. And you can view that data using the Xcode Organizer on your Mac.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Note: While there are several third-party analytics tools that can also provide information on crashing threads when incorporated into your app&#44; you may not always be able to see the full backtrace. Additionally&#44; the log you receive may not be in a format you can send to Apple when filing feedback.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here&#8217;s how you can access full crash reports directly from Xcode and your Mac&#8217;s Finder. Find your app&#8217;s crash logs There are two ways to view your app&#8217;s crash logs. The first provides you with at-a-glance information &#8212; like the percentage of people running into crashes on an earlier version of iOS &#8212; while the other offers a more detailed look at individual crash reports.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol&#62;&#60;li&#62;Open &#60;strong&#62;Xcode&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Select &#60;strong&#62;Window&#60;/strong&#62; from the menu bar.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Go to &#60;strong&#62;Organizer &#38;gt; Crashes&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Choose &#60;strong&#62;App Store&#60;/strong&#62; from the drop down menu.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here&#44; you can see crash reports from your app&#8217;s builds&#44; including TestFlight betas and versions you&#8217;ve released to the App Store. Browse all of your crashes at a glance&#44; and check out statistics to see how crashes break down across OS versions and different devices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And if you want to start troubleshooting on the spot&#44; you can even open a crash report and jump right to the affected line in Xcode by simply choosing the &#60;strong&#62;Open In Project&#60;/strong&#62; option. Review your app&#8217;s crash logs To check out individual crash logs in detail&#44; you&#8217;ll need to engage the power of your Control key.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Control-click&#60;/strong&#62; on the crash in question.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Choose &#60;strong&#62;Show in Finder&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;In the Finder window&#44; &#60;strong&#62;control-click&#60;/strong&#62; the highlighted .xccrashpoint file.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Choose &#60;strong&#62;Show Package Contents&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;In the folder that displays&#44; go to &#60;strong&#62;DistributionInfos &#38;gt; all &#38;gt; Logs&#60;/strong&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;&#60;p&#62;Inside the Logs folder&#44; you&#8217;ll find each individual crash report&#44; which you can browse and troubleshoot accordingly.

            <title>How to debug your SwiftUI previews in Xcode</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8vkqn3ih</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;How to debug your SwiftUI previews in Xcode&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With SwiftUI and Xcode 11&#44; it&#8217;s much faster to create great user interfaces for apps on iOS&#44; macOS&#44; watchOS&#44; and tvOS. As you write your app&#44; use Xcode&#8216;s design tools at any point to see live previews of your app in different states and on different compatible devices &#8212; all without launching Simulator.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And here&#8217;s a valuable tip: We&#8217;re going to break down how you can debug that SwiftUI code live in Xcode&#44; too. Enable Debug Preview in Xcode 11 When creating an interface for your app in SwiftUI&#44; you&#8216;ll see a preview inside Xcode that displays your app&#44; formatted for your currently-selected device.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#8217;re hitting an issue in your code&#44; however&#44; and don&#8217;t know where to troubleshoot&#44; you can instead enable Debug Preview to quickly find that pesky bug. Here&#8217;s how to do it. 1. Open your Swift project in Xcode 11. 2. Right-click (or Control-click) on the Live Preview button in the bottom right corner of the preview. 3. Select Debug Preview.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now&#44; you can troubleshoot your SwiftUI project using all of the usual debugging tools&#44; such as breakpoints&#44; view debugging&#44; memory graph debugging&#44; and logging to the Console.

            <title>The App Store is Expanding to New Countries</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03232020a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;The App Store is Expanding to New Countries&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Thanks to the creativity and innovation of developers like you&#44; the &#123;App Store&#125; has become much more than the world&#8217;s safest marketplace. It&#8217;s grown into a vibrant platform with great apps that influence culture and change lives&#44; with over half a billion visitors each week. This wide-reaching platform has helped generate over &#36;155 billion in developer earnings &#8212; just from sales of apps and in-app purchases. Today&#44; the &#123;App Store&#125; gives you the opportunity to connect with users in 155 countries or regions. We&#8217;re pleased to announce that the &#123;App Store&#125; will expand even farther this year with upcoming support for 20 new countries&#44; allowing you to increase your impact and grow your business in new markets. To allow your app to appear in these new countries&#44; your membership &#123;Account Holder&#125; first needs to accept the updated Program License Agreement by signing in to their account on the &#123;Apple Developer&#125; website. If you have a Paid Applications Agreement&#44; the &#123;Account Holder&#125; will also need to accept this updated agreement in &#123;App Store Connect.&#125; You can then select the &#8220;New Countries or Regions&#8221; checkbox in the Pricing and Availability section of your app information page to automatically make your app available in all new countries. Completing these steps by April 10&#44; 2020 will help make sure your app is ready to be published as content initially becomes available across new locations. We&#8217;ll let you know when you can choose from specific new countries and update the default subscription pricing for these locations. &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/account/&#34;&#62;View your account&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Ensuring the Credibility of Health &#38; Safety Information</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03142020a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Ensuring the Credibility of Health &#38;amp; Safety Information The App Store should always be a safe and trusted place for users to download apps. Now more than ever that commitment takes on special significance as the world fights the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities around the world are depending on apps to be credible news sources &#8212; helping users understand the latest health innovations&#44; find out where they can get help if needed or provide assistance to their neighbors.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To help fulfill these expectations&#44; we&#39;re evaluating apps critically to ensure data sources are reputable and that developers presenting these apps are from recognized entities such as government organizations&#44; health-focused NGOs&#44; companies deeply credentialed in health issues&#44; and medical or educational institutions. Only developers from one of these recognized entities should submit an app related to COVID-19. Entertainment or game apps with COVID-19 as their theme will not be allowed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We understand the need to get these apps into the hands of customers as soon as possible. We encourage developers that meet this criteria to select &#8220;Time-Sensitive Event&#8221; on the expedite request form to ensure prioritized review since App Store review may take longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you are developing an app on behalf of a client&#44; please advise your client to add you to the development team of their Apple Developer account. If your client does not yet have an Apple Developer account&#44; they can enroll in the &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/programs/&#34;&#62;Apple Developer Program&#60;/a&#62;. Nonprofit organizations&#44; accredited educational institutions&#44; and government entities that plan to distribute only free apps on the App Store can request to have their annual membership fee waived&#44; if based in an eligible country.

            <title>Updates to Universal Purchase and App Store Categories</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=02052020a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Updates to Universal Purchase and App Store Categories&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Starting in March 2020&#44; you&#8217;ll be able to distribute iOS&#44; iPadOS&#44; macOS&#44; and tvOS versions of your app as a universal purchase&#44; allowing customers to enjoy your app and in&#8209;app purchases across platforms by purchasing only once. You can choose to create a new app for these platforms using a single app record in App Store Connect or add platforms to your existing app record. Get started by building and testing your apps using a single bundle ID with Xcode 11.4 beta.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In addition&#44; App Store categories will be unified across the App Store and Mac App Store to align with this change&#44; and to help make your apps more discoverable. The following changes will be made.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;You&#8217;ll be able to select the following categories for iOS apps: &#8220;Developer Tools&#8221; and &#8220;Graphics &#38;amp; Design&#8221;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;You&#8217;ll be able to select the following categories for macOS apps: &#8220;Books&#8221;&#44; &#8220;Food &#38;amp; Drink&#8221;&#44; &#8220;Magazines &#38;amp; Newspapers&#8221;&#44; &#8220;Navigation&#8221;&#44; and &#8220;Shopping&#8221;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;The &#8220;Photography&#8221; and &#8220;Video&#8221; categories on the Mac App Store will be combined into &#8220;Photo &#38;amp; Video&#8221;. Mac apps and pending updates with the &#8220;Photography&#8221; or &#8220;Video&#8221; category selected in App Store Connect will be moved automatically to the combined category.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#8220;Kids&#8221; will no longer be a subcategory within &#8220;Games&#8221; on the Mac App Store.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a reminder&#44; you can change the categories and subcategories associated with your app at any time with an app update. &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing_your_app_for_beta_testing_and_releases&#34;&#62;Learn how to set up universal purchase in Xcode&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#dev97865727c&#34;&#62;Learn how to edit app information in App Store Connect&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>App Updates for HTML5 Apps</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01212020a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;App Updates for HTML5 Apps&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The App Store Review Guidelines are designed to help developers create apps that are secure&#44; high-quality&#44; reliable&#44; and that respect user privacy. In order to ensure this&#44; we&#8217;ve always specified that all apps be self-contained bundles. This means that the core features and functionality of the app must be contained within the software&#8217;s binary&#44; rather than made possible by referring users outside of the approved app &#8212; including through the use of HTML5. Apps that dynamically provide core features and functionality with web technology like HTML5 are best delivered through Safari&#44; rather than through the curated App Store.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software&#34;&#62;Guideline 4.7 sections 4&#44; 5&#44; and 6&#60;/a&#62; were updated in June 2019 to further clarify that apps containing or running code that is not embedded in the binary cannot provide access to real money gaming&#44; lotteries&#44; or charitable donations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a reminder&#44; existing apps must be in full compliance with these guidelines by March 3&#44; 2020.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;App Updates in the Kids Category&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When parents visit the Kids category on the App Store&#44; they expect that the apps they find are suitable for children. That&#8217;s why apps published on the App Store must protect children&#8217;s data and provide only age-appropriate content. Apps must also require a parental gate in order to link out of the app&#44; request permissions&#44; or present purchasing opportunities. It&#8217;s critical that apps do not transmit personally identifiable information or device information to third parties&#44; and that advertisements are human-reviewed for age appropriateness in order to be displayed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a reminder&#44; existing apps in the Kids category on the App Store must be in full compliance with the updated &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids-category&#34;&#62;guideline 1.3&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids&#34;&#62;guideline 5.1.4&#60;/a&#62; by March 3&#44; 2020.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Using Auto-Renewable Subscriptions Auto-renewable subscriptions give users access to content&#44; services&#44; or premium features in your app on an ongoing basis. At the end of each subscription duration&#44; the subscription automatically renews until a user chooses to cancel it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Great subscription apps justify the recurring payment by providing ongoing value to users and continually innovating the app experience.

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Upcoming Price and Tax Changes in Pakistan&#44; Thailand&#44; and Singapore&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When taxes or foreign exchange rates change&#44; we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store. In the next few days&#44; prices of apps on the App Store and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) will change in the following countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#8226; Thailand: Prices will decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates. &#8226; Pakistan: Prices will increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Additionally&#44; on January 1&#44; 2020&#44; a 7&#37; goods and services tax (GST) was introduced in Singapore. Developers based in Singapore who provide their GST number in App Store Connect will not have their proceeds affected. Otherwise&#44; proceeds will be adjusted accordingly. Prices on the App Store won&#8217;t change based on the introduction of this tax.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Once these changes go into effect&#44; the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in App Store Connect. For subscriptions&#44; you have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers. &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/011020-Apps-Pricing-Thailand-Pakistan.pdf&#34;&#62;View the updated price tier charts&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Building Adaptive User Interfaces for iPhone and iPad Apps should look great on all models of iPhone and iPad&#44; regardless of display size or aspect ratio. With features like Xcode storyboards and Auto Layout&#44; your app&#8217;s interface elements and layouts automatically fit the display. As announced at WWDC19&#44; starting April 2020&#44; apps submitted to the App Store must use an Xcode storyboard to provide the app&#8217;s launch screen and must have an interface that supports any display size.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Support for Multitasking on iPad is strongly encouraged. Adding support for multiple windows&#44; and adopting Multitasking capabilities&#44; including Slide Over&#44; Split View&#44; and Picture in Picture&#44; will ensure your app delivers a modern and complete experience on iPadOS. &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/&#34;&#62;Learn about designing adaptive interfaces&#60;/a&#62; &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/multitasking/&#34;&#62;Learn about multitasking on iPad&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Updating Apps that Use Web Views&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If your app still embeds web content using the deprecated UIWebView API&#44; we strongly encourage you to update to WKWebView as soon as possible for improved security and reliability.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;WKWebView ensures that compromised web content doesn&#8217;t affect the rest of an app by limiting web processing to the app&#39;s web view. And it&#8217;s supported in iOS and macOS&#44; and by Mac Catalyst.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The App Store will no longer accept new apps using UIWebView as of April 2020 and app updates using UIWebView as of December 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview&#34;&#62;Learn more about WKWebView&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Update to Notarization Prerequisites</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Update to Notarization Prerequisites&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In June&#44; we announced that all Mac software distributed outside the Mac App Store must be notarized by Apple in order to run by default on macOS Catalina. In September&#44; we temporarily adjusted the notarization prerequisites to make this transition easier and to protect users on macOS Catalina who continue to use older versions of software.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Starting February 3&#44; 2020&#44; all submitted software must meet the original notarization prerequisites.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you haven&#8217;t yet done so&#44; upload your software to the notary service and review the developer log for warnings. These warnings will become errors starting February 3 and must be fixed in order to have your software notarized. Software notarized before February 3 will continue to run by default on macOS Catalina.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a reminder&#44; all installer packages must be signed since they may contain executable code. Disk images do not need to be signed&#44; although signing them can help your users verify their contents.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/&#34;&#62;Learn about notarizing software&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Apple Joins New Smart Home Initiative&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Apple is taking a major step in its approach to the smart home by joining a new industry effort with Amazon&#44; Google&#44; Zigbee Alliance&#44; and others. The initiative aims to develop an open standard that will increase the compatibility of smart home products across multiple platforms&#44; with security and privacy as fundamental design tenets. The new standard will make it even simpler for developers to build one device that is compatible with smart home services and voice assistants&#44; while ensuring consumers can easily choose smart home products that seamlessly work together.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/news/?id&#61;12182019a&#34;&#62;Learn more about the initiative&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Notarize Your Mac Software for &#123;macOS Catalina&#125;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To further protect users on &#123;macOS Catalina&#44;&#125; we&#8217;re working with developers to make sure all software&#44; whether distributed on the &#123;App Store&#125; or outside of it&#44; is signed or notarized by Apple. This will give users more confidence that the software they download and run&#44; no matter where they get it from&#44; has been checked for known security issues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In June&#44; we announced that all Mac software distributed outside the &#123;Mac App Store&#125; must be notarized by Apple in order to run by default on &#123;macOS Catalina.&#125; Make sure to test all versions of your software on the &#123;macOS Catalina&#125; &#123;GM seed&#125; and submit it to Apple to &#123;be notarized&#125;.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Tax Changes Will Affect &#123;App Store&#125; Prices in Japan&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When taxes or foreign exchange rates change&#44; we sometimes need to update prices on the &#123;App Store.&#125; Starting October 2019&#44; the Japan Consumption Tax (JCT) will increase from 8&#37; to 10&#37;&#44; resulting in a price increase for apps on the &#123;App Store&#125; and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) in Japan. Once the change goes into effect&#44; the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated and your proceeds will be increased accordingly. You can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in &#123;App Store Connect.&#125; For subscriptions&#44; you have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Note that Apple does not administer the collection and remittance of JCT applicable to sales to customers purchasing content on the &#123;App Store&#125; in Japan. You will continue to be responsible for the collection and remittance of such taxes to the appropriate tax authorities&#44; as may be required by local law.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#123;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/180919Japan.pdf&#34;&#62;View updated price tiers&#60;/a&#62;&#125;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Updated Certificate for Game Center Authentication&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A new certificate for server-based &#123;Game Center&#125; verification is available via the publicKeyUrl property of &#123;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayer/1515407-generateidentityverificationsign&#34;&#62;generateIdentityVerificationSignature&#60;/a&#62;&#125;. The previous certificate will no longer be available as of September 17&#44; 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Make sure your app always retrieves and uses the current publicKeyUrl value so it automatically uses the new certificate. If your app caches the certificate or hardcodes the certificate URL&#44; it will require an update.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#123;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/381711&#34;&#62;Learn more&#60;/a&#62;&#125;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Introducing Billing Grace Period for Subscriptions&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We&#8217;ve worked closely with leading developers to create a solution for reducing customer churn while improving the experience for auto-renewable subscriptions. With the new grace period for unsuccessful auto-renewals&#44; subscribers can continue accessing your app&#8217;s paid content while Apple attempts to collect payment &#8212; allowing them time to fix the issue. There won&#8217;t be any interruption to the subscriber&#8217;s days of paid service or to your revenue if payment is successful within the grace period.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/whats-new/?id&#61;billinggraceperiod&#34;&#62;Learn more&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>New Guidelines for Sign in with Apple</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019b</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;New Guidelines for Sign in with Apple&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Make it easy for users to sign in to your apps and websites using the &#123;Apple ID&#125; they already have. With privacy and security features built-in&#44; &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/&#34;&#62;Sign in with Apple&#60;/a&#62; is a great way to help users set up an account&#44; sign in&#44; and engage with your app quickly and easily. All accounts are protected with two-factor authentication for superior security&#44; and Apple will not track users&#8217; activity in your app or website.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We&#8217;ve updated the &#123;App Store&#125; Review Guidelines to provide criteria for when apps are required to use &#123;Sign in with Apple&#125;. Starting today&#44; new apps submitted to the &#123;App Store&#125; must follow these guidelines. Existing apps and app updates must follow them by &#123;April 2020&#125;. We&#8217;ve also provided new guidelines for using Sign in with Apple on the web and other platforms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple&#34;&#62;View the App Store review guideline&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/usage-guidelines-for-websites-and-other-platforms/&#34;&#62;View guidelines for websites and other platforms&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;App Updates in the Kids Category&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When parents visit the Kids category on the &#123;App Store&#125;&#44; they expect the apps they find will protect their children&#8217;s data&#44; provide only age-appropriate content&#44; and require a parental gate in order to link out of the app&#44; request permissions&#44; or present purchasing opportunities. It&#8217;s critical that no personally identifiable information or device information be transmitted to third parties&#44; and that advertisements are human-reviewed for age appropriateness in order to be displayed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids-category&#34;&#62;Guideline 1.3&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids&#34;&#62;guideline 5.1.4&#60;/a&#62; detail important rules related to apps in the Kids category and we&#8217;ve been working with some developers of existing apps to assist them in the transition to full compliance with this important guideline.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All new apps must follow these guidelines&#44; and we urge you to update your existing apps as soon as possible. If your existing app requires more time to implement these guidelines&#44; we&#8217;ve provided an additional six months&#44; until March 3&#44; 2020&#44; to bring it into full compliance.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;App Updates for HTML5 Apps&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In order to provide users with the secure and curated experience that they expect on the &#123;App Store&#44;&#125; we have always specified that apps must be self-contained bundles. This means that the core features and functionality of the app must be contained within the binary of the software&#44; rather than made possible by referring users outside of the approved app&#44; including through the use of HTML5. Apps that provide core features and functionality dynamically with web technology like HTML5 are best delivered to everyone in Safari&#44; rather than through the curated &#123;App Store.&#125;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To prevent fraud and abuse&#44; the exceptions to this rule have always been very narrow. In June&#44; we updated &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software&#34;&#62;guideline 4.7 sections 4&#44; 5&#44; &#38;amp; 6&#60;/a&#62;&#44; to further narrow these exceptions and clarify an existing restriction. Apps containing or running code that is not embedded in the binary cannot provide access to real money gaming&#44; lotteries&#44; or charitable donations&#44; among other changes.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All new apps must follow this guideline and we urge you to update your existing apps as soon as possible. If your existing app requires more time to implement the guidelines&#44; we&#8217;ve provided an additional six months&#44; until March 3&#44; 2020&#44; to bring it into compliance.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Submitting a Capability Request for Apps Using MDM</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09062019a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Submitting a Capability Request for Apps Using MDM&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a powerful and wide-reaching technology that grants a broad range of access to and control over users&#8217; devices. While these capabilities are necessary to effectively manage a large number of devices&#44; and in limited cases for parental control services&#44; they also have the potential to create user privacy and security issues if not used properly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In June&#44; we announced that apps seeking to include MDM technology must first submit an MDM capability request. This process will evaluate how the app will use MDM in order to prevent abuse and ensure that no data is shared with third parties. The MDM capability will be re-evaluated on an annual basis&#44; and you will need to submit a new request each year. We have worked with developers of parental control apps who have successfully completed this process and are now providing safer apps for kids and their families.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This new guideline was effective for all apps on June 3&#44; 2019. If you already have an app on the &#123;App Store&#125; that uses MDM capabilities but does not follow the new guideline&#44; &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/mdm-capability&#34;&#62;submit an MDM capability&#60;/a&#62; request as soon as possible.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#mobile-device-management&#34;&#62;View the Mobile Device Management guideline&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Notarizing Your Mac Software for &#123;macOS Catalina&#125;</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09032019a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Notarizing Your Mac Software for &#123;macOS Catalina&#125;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a reminder&#44; Mac software distributed outside the &#123;Mac App Store&#125; must be notarized by Apple in order to run on &#123;macOS Catalina.&#125; To make this transition easier and to protect users on &#123;macOS Catalina&#125; who continue to use older versions of software&#44; we&#8217;ve adjusted the notarization prerequisites until January 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can now notarize Mac software that:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;Doesn&#8217;t have the Hardened Runtime capability enabled.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Has components not signed with your Developer ID.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Doesn&#8217;t include a secure timestamp with your code-signing signature.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Was built with an older SDK.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Includes the com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;Make sure to submit all versions of your software. While Xcode 10 or later is still required to submit&#44; you don&#8217;t need to rebuild or re-sign your software before submission.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Get Ready for Dark Mode&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dark Mode introduces a dramatic new look for iPhone and iPad that is seamlessly integrated throughout the system and simple to turn on from Control Center or Siri. With a dark appearance for all user interface elements&#44; your app&#8217;s content becomes the focus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When a user has Dark Mode turned on&#44; all apps built with the &#123;iOS 13&#125; SDK will run in &#123;Dark Mode&#125;. Learn how to optimize for Dark Mode&#44; then test your apps on a device running the latest beta version of &#123;iOS 13&#125; or iPadOS. If you need more time to make your apps look fantastic in Dark Mode&#44; or if Dark Mode is not suited for your app&#44; you can learn how to opt out.&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <title>Upcoming Changes for 17&#43; Age Ratings and App Availability</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=08192019a</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Upcoming Changes for 17&#43; Age Ratings and App Availability&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In an effort to open up additional opportunities for developers&#44; we&#8217;ve worked with the government of the Republic of Korea on making more apps available on the &#123;App Store&#125; in the Republic of Korea. And to ensure that our global age rating system continues to help make the &#123;App Store&#125; safe for kids&#44; apps that feature Frequent/Intense Simulated Gambling will be rated 17&#43; in all countries and regions starting August 20&#44; 2019.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If your app meets at least one of the criteria below&#44; you&#8217;ll be able to offer it on the &#123;App Store&#125; in the Republic of Korea to users 19 years of age or older. You&#8217;ll need to enter a Rating Classification Number from the Game Rating and Administration Committee in &#123;App Store&#125; Connect&#44; and can do so starting August 20. Apps with a number entered at this time will be published later this week. If you don&#8217;t have a Rating Classification Number&#44; you can &#123;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://www.grac.or.kr/english/&#34;&#62;apply for one now&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;Apps in the Casino subcategory with age rating 17&#43;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Apps in the Games or Entertainment categories with Frequent/Intense selected for at least one of the following content descriptions:&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;Simulated Gambling&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;Sexual Content or Nudity&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Alcohol&#44; Tobacco&#44; or Drug Use or Reference&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Realistic Violence&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;To enter your Rating Classification Number:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol&#62;&#60;li&#62;Sign in to &#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/&#34;&#62;App Store Connect&#60;/a&#62;&#125;.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Go to My Apps and select your app from the list.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;In the App Information section under Availability in the Republic of Korea&#44; enter your Rating Classification Number.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Submit your app for review.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;</description>

            <title>Updates to the App Store Review Guidelines</title>
            <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j</link>
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Updates to the App Store Review Guidelines&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The App Store is dedicated to the best store experience for everyone. In order to continue providing a safe experience for users and a great opportunity for developers to be successful&#44; we sometimes need to update the App Store Review Guidelines.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Please note these summaries of the latest changes and see the App Store Review Guidelines for full details. All guidelines are now enforced for new and existing apps&#44; unless otherwise indicated.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guidelines 1.3 and 5.1.4.&#60;/strong&#62; In order to help keep kids&#8217; data private&#44; apps in the kids category and apps intended for kids cannot include third-party advertising or analytics software and may not transmit data to third parties. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3&#44; 2019.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 4.7.&#60;/strong&#62; HTML5 games distributed in apps may not provide access to real money gaming&#44; lotteries&#44; or charitable donations&#44; and may not support digital commerce. This functionality is only appropriate for code that&#8217;s embedded in the binary and can be reviewed by Apple. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3&#44; 2019.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 5.4.&#60;/strong&#62; Because VPN provides access to sensitive data&#44; VPN apps may not sell&#44; use&#44; or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose&#44; and must commit to this in their privacy policy. Certain types of apps &#8212; such as those for parental control&#44; content blocking&#44; and security &#8212; from approved providers may use the NEVPNManager API.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 5.5. (New)&#60;/strong&#62; Because MDM provides access to sensitive data&#44; MDM apps must request the mobile device management capability&#44; and may only be offered by commercial enterprises&#44; such as business organizations&#44; educational institutions&#44; or government agencies&#44; and&#44; in limited cases&#44; companies utilizing MDM for parental controls. MDM apps may not sell&#44; use&#44; or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose&#44; and must commit to this in their privacy policy.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 5.1.3(i).&#60;/strong&#62; Apps may use a user&#8217;s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user&#44; such as a reduced insurance premium&#44; if the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit and the data is not shared with a third party. The developer must also disclose to the user the specific health data collected from the device.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 5.1.1(viii) (New).&#60;/strong&#62; Apps that compile information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user&#8217;s explicit consent&#44; even public databases&#44; are not permitted on the App Store.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 5.1.1(ii).&#60;/strong&#62; Apps must get consent for data collection&#44; even if the data is considered anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 1.1.3.&#60;/strong&#62; Apps may not facilitate purchase of ammunition.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Guideline 4.2.7.&#60;/strong&#62; Remote desktop clients now include game consoles owned by the user. Software appearing in the client must be fully executed on the host device.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;Demo videos of app functionality that is geo-locked or otherwise restricted are not accepted. Developers must provide a fully functional app for review.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sign in with Apple will be available for beta testing this summer. It will be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#123;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&#34;&#62;Read App Store Review Guidelines&#60;/a&#62;&#125;&#60;/p&#62;</description>

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Bring Your iPad App to Mac&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now it&#8217;s incredibly simple to start building a native Mac app from your current iPad app. The beta version of Xcode 11 is all you need. Your Mac and iPad apps share the same project and source code&#44; so any changes you make translate to both platforms. And your newly created Mac app runs natively&#44; utilizing the same frameworks&#44; resources&#44; and even runtime environment as apps built just for Mac.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href&#61;&#34;https://developer.apple.com/ipad-apps-for-mac/&#34;&#62;Learn more&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</description>
