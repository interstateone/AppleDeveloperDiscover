# Apple Developer Discover RSS Feed

The new Apple Developer app has some neat content that isn't (yet?) available with an RSS feed. This generates that RSS feed.

A small Swift program is run daily and on pushes to generate the feed and publish it to GitHub Pages here: [https://interstateone.github.io/AppleDeveloperDiscover/feed.xml](https://interstateone.github.io/AppleDeveloperDiscover/feed.xml)
